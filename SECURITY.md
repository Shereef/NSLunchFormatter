## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them directly to [Shereef Marzouk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shereef/) instead of using the public issue tracker. This helps ensure that any security issues are addressed promptly and responsibly.

Please include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including:

-   A description of the vulnerability
-   Steps to reproduce the issue
-   Potential impact
-   Any suggested mitigation or fix

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a detailed response within 5 business days, including an expected timeline for a fix.
